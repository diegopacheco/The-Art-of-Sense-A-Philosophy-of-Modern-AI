# Glossary

## A

**AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**
A theoretical form of AI that would have human-like general intelligence, capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks. The book discusses whether AGI will happen and the marketing hype around it.

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**
The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. The book focuses on practical applications of AI in software engineering.

**AI Hallucination**
When AI generates information that appears plausible but is actually incorrect or made up. AI can create APIs that don't exist or code that contains runtime bugs.

## C

**Clever Hans Effect**
A phenomenon where an observer unconsciously gives cues to a subject, leading to apparent intelligent behavior that is actually based on picking up subtle hints rather than true understanding.

## G

**Generative AI**
AI systems that can generate new content, including text, code, images, and other media. The book focuses on using Generative AI for software engineering tasks.

## L

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
A type of AI model trained on massive amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Examples include GPT, Claude, and other similar models. LLMs work by predicting the next sequence of tokens.

## T

**Tokens**
The basic units that LLMs process. Text is broken down into tokens, and LLMs predict the next token in a sequence. Understanding tokens is key to understanding how Generative AI works.

## V

**Vibe Coding**
A practice coined by Andrej Karpathy where developers generate prompts and do not look at the generated code, assuming AI will handle everything correctly. The book argues this is a bad practice for serious software engineering, especially for core business logic.

**Vibe Payments**
A satirical concept introduced in the book suggesting that if developers use "vibe coding" without reviewing code, their payments should also be random and unpredictable, reflecting the lack of due diligence in their work.
