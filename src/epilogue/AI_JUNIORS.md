# AI and Juniors

Seniors engineers know a lot of things, but to quote a fews things:
* The Fundamentals: They know how Data Structures and Algorithms work.
* Troubleshooting: They know how to debug complex issues.
* Some Architecture Skills: They know how to design systems that scale.
* Ownership: They take responsibility for the code they write.

More importantly, they know how to learn new things, and how to adapt to new technologies.
Juniors in the other hand did not master any of these skills yet, and they are still learning the basics of programming.

It's silly to think that if Juniors just use AI they will get 2-10x better. Sure might might be able to get things done faster, but do not full your self. Juniors must learn the fundamentals. Now, today there are companies like Netflix, and several others in Silicon Valley that do not hire juniors at all. They think that juniors are not worth the investment. Because there is a huge pool of talent in SV and they pay more so they an be picky.

Now Let's keep on thing in mind, IF AI creates disruption on the workforce, where no one wants juniors anymore since you can "do 2-10x more with AI"(BTW I don't belive in this - but let's stick to that for sake of argument). seniors will retireve and Juniors will have a hard time joining the workforce, now - would you have good seniors in the future if they are not really learnings skills they are just being "produtive with AI"? Well the time will say but we might have a distrous effect on the talent pool in the future for our industry.

## What the HECK is a company? (Execution and Learning)

Have you ever thought about what a company really is?You migth say the company is his products brand or services. But a company it's made of people, the hability to organize and scale people to execute on a vision is what makes a company great. Such hability is called Execution. Execution matters a lot. But there is another thing that matter a lot too, the capacity of `Actually Learning`, new process, new ways of working, new technologies, new markets, new ways of organization, the capacity to learn is what makes a company adapt and survive on the long run.So in other words, the most effective companies are the ones who can learn and re-invent themselves while executing on their vision. Companies now need to learn how to `Deal with AI`, but they also need to learn how to play the long term game, not the next 5 years but the nest 50 years.

As the future of work changes, due AI and other forms of disruption, companies must adapt and change as well. But companies need to be careful, just because one strategy worked on the past, does not means it will worrk on the future.

[Gergely Orosz, has this amazing interview with Netflix CTO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAp9RjO79cU&t=1s), where they explain that historically Netflix never hired juniors, just seniors, the famous "Talent Density" strategy. Now Netfflix is hiring grad studants (Juniors).
