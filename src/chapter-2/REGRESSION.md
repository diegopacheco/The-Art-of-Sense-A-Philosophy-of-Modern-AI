# Regression

Regression is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input features. Unlike classification, where the output is categorical, regression deals with numerical values.

Common use cases for regression include:
* Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
* Forecasting stock prices based on historical data.
* Estimating sales figures based on marketing spend and other factors.

Main algorithms used for regression tasks include:
* Linear Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Support Vector Machines
