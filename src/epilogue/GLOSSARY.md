# Glossary

## A

**AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**
The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. The book focuses on practical applications of AI in software engineering.

**AI Hallucination**
When AI generates information that appears plausible but is actually incorrect or made up. AI can create APIs that don't exist, generate code with runtime bugs, or ignore specific requests entirely.

**AI Input vs Output**
A methodology where developers use AI for input (research, learning, inspiration) while maintaining critical review responsibility rather than blindly accepting AI-generated output without evaluation.

**AI Scams**
Deceptive practices involving AI technology, including false AGI claims, wrapper solutions marketed as novel AI applications, and misleading marketing around AI capabilities.

**Agents**
Autonomous or semi-autonomous systems that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with environments using AI capabilities.

**Agentic Behavior**
Behavior exhibited by agents that allows them to act autonomously in pursuit of defined goals, making decisions based on environment state.

## B

**Classification**
A Traditional AI/ML task involving categorizing data into predefined classes or categories based on learned patterns.

**Clever Hans Effect**
A phenomenon where an observer unconsciously gives cues to a subject, leading to apparent intelligent behavior that is actually based on picking up subtle hints rather than true understanding.

**Clustering**
A Traditional AI/ML unsupervised learning task involving grouping similar data points together without predefined labels.

**Code Review**
Critical process of examining AI-generated or any code for correctness, security, and alignment with requirements before deployment. Essential when using AI.

**Custom Agents**
Agents specifically built or configured for particular use cases or organizations.

**Custom Commands**
Specific commands or workflows configured within Claude Code or similar tools for specialized tasks.

## D

The transformative impact of AI on industries and engineering practices, similar to impacts of internet and mobile phones.

**Documentation**
Using AI to generate and maintain code documentation, changelogs, and knowledge bases.

## E

**Embeddings**
Numerical vector representations of text, images, or other data that capture semantic meaning. Essential for RAG and vector databases. Can represent words, sentences, or entire documents.

**Engineering with AI**
The practice of applying AI tools and methodologies to improve software development processes.

## F

**Fine Tuning**
Process of training a pre-trained model on specific domain data to adapt it to particular use cases without full retraining.

## G

**Generative AI**
AI systems that can generate new content, including text, code, images, and other media. The book focuses on using Generative AI for software engineering tasks. Works through predicting next tokens/sequences.

**Git Archaeology for Troubleshooting**
Technique using git history to understand code evolution and diagnose issues.

## I

**Image Generation**
Generative AI capability for creating visual content from text descriptions or other inputs.

**Inventory (Migrations)**
Process of cataloging and assessing existing systems, code, and infrastructure before planning migrations.

## K

**Knowledge Base Generation**
Using AI to create and maintain comprehensive documentation systems.

## L

**Learning from AI**
Process of using AI as an educational tool while maintaining critical thinking and verification.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
A type of AI model trained on massive amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Examples include GPT, Claude, and other similar models. LLMs work by predicting the next sequence of tokens. Cannot truly "think" despite marketing claims.

**LLMs as Slot Machines**
Concept by Cory Doctorow describing LLMs as fundamentally random/probabilistic systems predicting next tokens, not deterministic reasoning engines.

## M

**Marketing and AI**
The often misleading promotion of AI capabilities, including false AGI claims and overstated application benefits.

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
A protocol for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources, enabling extended capabilities.

**Migrations**
Process of moving systems, code, libraries, or data from one platform, language, or infrastructure to another.

**Migrations in Phases**
Structured approach to performing migrations incrementally rather than all at once.

**Mirror on Steroids**
Concept that AI amplifies existing abilities: good engineers become better with AI; poor engineers become worse.

## P

**Precision and Reproducibility**
Challenge with AI systems: inability to guarantee identical outputs for identical inputs due to probabilistic nature.

**Prompts**
Instructions or queries given to AI systems to generate desired outputs.

**Proof of Concepts (POCs)**
Small-scale implementations to test feasibility and validate ideas before full-scale development.

**Proof Reader**
Using AI to check spelling, grammar, and document quality in written content.

## R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
Technique combining document retrieval with LLM generation, allowing AI to cite and incorporate external information into responses.

**Randomness in AI**
Inherent probabilistic nature of LLMs making outputs non-deterministic even with identical inputs.

**Vibe Payments**
A satirical concept introduced in the book suggesting that if developers use "vibe coding" without reviewing code, their payments should also be random and unpredictable, reflecting the lack of due diligence in their work.
