# Context 7

[Context7](https://context7.com/) fixes a limitation LLMs have. LLMs have a hard time to know the latest versions, since they are always behind the latest data. Context7 provides a way to connect LLMs to the latest data.

## Telling AI what todo

It's always important, that in your prompt you tell AI the versions you want. However is also important that you READ THE CODE because is not uncomon for LLM models to use downgrafed versions of libraries. i.e you asked for NodeJS 24, AI give to you code for NodeJS 20. This happens very often.

## Context7 Make it better

Context7 has a [MCP](https://github.com/upstash/context7) that allow you to use it with most of the popular code agents. Context7 has up to date documentation on latest versions of libraries and frameworks.

27.OCT.2025 when I checked context7 webside they had suppport for `49,317 Libraries` which is a lot. They are always updating the library list and information for methods, and apis.
