# Chapter 6 - Testing with AI

Testing matters more than ever with AI. Because AI halucinates e eventually will mess up your existing code, and will stop working, so when you will catch that? hopefully before your users do. Because AI is not 100% predictable and has precision issues, you make have tests to compensate that.

Otherwise AI will break your code, it's just a matter of time, will happen. As long as you have good testing diversity and decent coverage, you will be fine because tests are the ultimate guardrails for AI.

So before AI 100% tests sounded crazy, but now is actually a must have. Ohterwise AI will introduce a lot of P0 bugs more often than you can imagine. Before we do any other more adevanced use case for coding agents using AI, we need to get more tests and get good and reliable tests in place.
