# AI Input

People see AI as output. As a way to "Beef Up" engineers. It's not wrong but you can't just use AI and never look at the code, this is a recipe for disaster.

AI can be a great teacher, however we need to always remember the teacher makes mistakes too. [Using AI for input](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/09/ai-output.html) is still a great advantage, you preserve the output to be yours.

## A tale of High School

When I was in high school. I remember a teacher of mine saying that people would go to google.com and just search for past year class and find the same homework and download a power point presentation and simply change their name on it. Of course this would never work because the teacher was smarter and usually people doing that took ZERO.

Using AI just for output, "vibe coding" is shutting down your brain and we are not even close to having AGI. So this is a recipe for disaster. IMHO it is not different than copying someone's homework and just putting your name on it.

Now of course, people will use the internet and it's okay to be "inspired" by somebody else's work, no one starts from scratch but you need to spend the time and review and change it.

## Lack of Respect

It's a lack of respect to throw some code to someone to review when the reviewer is the first person to read it, before even the "maker" or to be more honest the "viber". For this reason and 100 other reasons you need to read code AI produces.

## You + AI

Now if you use AI for input and do the due diligence process, then you actually are doing this right, you are using AI for input but the output is yours, it's your code, your work, must have your fingerprints, that way we do best of both worlds. You learn, you produce and you grow.
