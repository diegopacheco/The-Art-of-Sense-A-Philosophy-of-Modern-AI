# Reality

Even with all the problems and the [scams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7DtiMzMBdU), AI is real and AI is here to stay. I don't know if [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) will happen one day—maybe, maybe not—but there is no indication we are close to [AGI](https://perry-douglas.medium.com/a-classic-con-e8c7f9f3d61d).

Don't be fooled by marketing from people saying they have AGI. People lie, and LLM models do not think, even if they say "thinking." Now, we don't need AGI to derive value from AI. AI is a force of disruption, just as we saw with the internet and mobile phones.

Therefore, change is happening, and you need to adapt to it. You can either be a victim of change or be the driver of change.

## Force of Disruption

AI is a force of disruption. For one reason, people believe it. [AI is not perfect](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/11/ai-coding-agents-economics.html), but does not need to be perfect. Yuval Harari said that we are in the "Amoeba age" of LLMs. That they are very basic and will get much better. I agree, but we don't know if it will be in 10 years or 500 years. What we do know is that AI is already disrupting many industries.

AI has the potential to disrupt like the internet, the mobile phone, and electricity did to some degree. For this reason alone, you should be paying attention.

## Scams

We also need to acknowledge that there are scams. So many scams, here is a list of some:
* [Turns Out That Extremely Impressive Sora Demo… Wasn’t Exactly Made With Sora](https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-sora-demo)
* [Prankster tricks a GM chatbot into agreeing to sell him a $76,000 Chevy Tahoe for $1](https://www.upworthy.com/prankster-tricks-a-gm-dealership-chatbot-to-sell-him-a-76000-chevy-tahoe-for-ex1)
* [The Rabbit Is A Scam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7DtiMzMBdU)
* [Taco Bell's Epic AI Fail 18,000 Waters](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IXMRiU3ogrA)
* [California issues historic fine over lawyer’s ChatGPT fabrications](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/09/chatgpt-lawyer-fine-ai-regulation/)

## From Recession to Rollback

In the beginning, people thought that everybody would lose their jobs, like:
* [AI is already taking white-collar jobs. Economists warn there’s ‘much more in the tank’](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/ai-taking-white-collar-jobs-economists-warn-much-more-in-the-tank.html)

Now we are seeing a rollback from "AI will take our jobs" to "We better rollback AI and get humans". Don't believe me? Here are some examples:
* [Here is a collection of AI failures](https://aicodinghorrors.com/)
* [$1.5 Billion AI Unicorn Collapse, All Offshore Programmers Impersonating!](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/24723372076545?utm_source=pocket_saves)
