# Private Teacher

AI can behave as a private teacher, providing personalized instruction and feedback to help learners improve their skills in various subjects. By analyzing a student's strengths and weaknesses, the AI can tailor lessons to meet individual needs, making learning more effective and engaging.

What would you use an AI private teacher for?
1. Lear a new language like Zig or Rust.
2. Learn a new skill like playing the cooking or writing.
3. Give you feedback on your work, like essays or code.
5. Help you prepare for exams or certifications.
6. Provide explanations and answer questions on complex topics.

## Non-Obvious Usage of AI as Teacher

1. Socratic Interrogation
Configure AI to NEVER give answers, only ask increasingly deeper questions until you discover the answer yourself. Forces real understanding.

2. Intellectual Honesty Detector
AI catches when you're fooling yourself about understanding something. "Explain this back to me" tests that reveal shallow knowledge.

3. Incompetence Illumination
AI deliberately gives you wrong answers mixed with correct ones to train you to spot errors and think critically.
