# Testing

You can't move if you don't have tests. Add tests first.

Since Gen-AI has this issue with `determinism`, it's very likely AI will introduce bugs, or even just delete whole features and mess up with things unrelated to your prompts.

Tests are a great way to compensate for that. Because good tests are deterministic, they will help you identify when something is broken.So before touching anything, make sure you have good testing in place, we can use AI to help us write those tests as well.
