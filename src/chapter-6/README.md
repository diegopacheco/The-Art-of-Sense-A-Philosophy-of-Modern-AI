# Chapter 6 - Testing with AI

Testing matters more than ever with AI. Because AI hallucinates and eventually will mess up your existing code, and will stop working, so when will you catch that? Hopefully before your users do. Because AI is not 100% predictable and has precision issues, you must have tests to compensate for that.

Otherwise, AI will break your code; it's just a matter of time, it will happen. As long as you have good testing diversity and decent coverage, you will be fine because tests are the ultimate guardrails for AI.

So before AI, 100% tests sounded crazy, but now it is actually a must-have. Otherwise, AI will introduce a lot of P0 bugs more often than you can imagine. Before we do any other more advanced use case for coding agents using AI, we need to get more tests and get good and reliable tests in place.
