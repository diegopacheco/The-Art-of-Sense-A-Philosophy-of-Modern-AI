# MCP and Claude Code

Anthropic created MCP to standardize how context is provided to LLMs. Claude Code as an AI coding agent leverages MCP to enhance its capabilities. However people think that claude code can only do things using MCP, which is not true. Claude Code has inside-of-the-box tools that can do several things. In other words Claude can do a lot without MCP.

I asked claude what tools it has inside of the box and this is what I got:

Prompt:
```
Tell me what tools Claude Code has inside-of-the-box. I don't want to know about MCP (external nor remote).
```
Result:
```
⏺ Claude Code has these built-in chat/interaction tools:

Task Management:
- TodoWrite - Create and manage task lists during coding sessions

User Interaction:
- AskUserQuestion - Ask questions during execution with multiple choice options (supports multi-select)

Extensibility:
- SlashCommand - Execute custom slash commands defined in .claude/commands/
- Skill - Execute skills (currently none installed in your environment)

Information Gathering:
- WebSearch - Search the web for current information
- WebFetch - Fetch and analyze content from URLs

Specialized Agents:
- Task - Launch specialized agents for complex tasks:
- Explore - Fast codebase exploration
- Plan - Planning agent
- general-purpose - Multi-step task handling
- changelog-generator - Generate changelogs from git commits
- marketing-agent - Translate technical content to plain language

All other tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, NotebookEdit) are file/system operation tools rather
than chat-specific features.
```

As you can see Claude can do a lot without MCP. One important thing that I need to call out is that because claude code can run bash commands in your terminal, that's perhaps one of the most powerful things in the universe. MCP is great but there are lots of bad actors out there and you need to be careful using MCP. Now using claude code tools and only leveraging what's in your machine, you are more secure. Because if you have a vetted process to get tools in your machine or you do your due diligence for what you install, then you can piggyback on that.

Running bash, it's a swiss army knife. You can do almost anything with bash. For instance, here is a list of things, and not limited but what claude can do with bash:
* **Run any docker container**: Same for podman. Yes there is a vector attack here, but if you get your containers from a internal trusted registry, you are gold.
* **Execute**: Claude can also execute any command on a container, so it can run sql, it can deploy pods in k8s, it can create data, it can do anything you can do in bash.
* **Script**: Claude can create the script you need to get something done and executed.


## Status Line

Claude [status Line](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/statusline), it's a feature where you can customize the status line that appears at the bottom of the Claude Code interface. You can do that to display useful information, there is a MCP for that called `ccstatusline`. You can use that MCP to create your [own status line](https://github.com/sirmalloc/ccstatusline).

To install:
```bash
npx ccstatusline@latest
```
```
