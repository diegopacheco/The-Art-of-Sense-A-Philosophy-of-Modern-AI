# Spec Driven Development (SDD)

Spec Driven Development (SDD) is an approach to software development where the specifications of the software are written before the actual implementation begins. This specification serves as a guide for developers throughout the development process. Such ideas are not new and in the past you might hear them as Model Driven Development (MDD). 

Here is a summary with SDD problems:

Basically the problem is that more text != more clarity. There are serious context windown overheads and even evidence showing more text not necessary drive better results. I also belive we are going back to a dangerous place where we would give code up and and just management documents. We need remember this old catastrophic approach called `Waterfall`. SDD has the potential to bring waterfall back which is anti-agile.

I'm not alone, here is a great [critique on SDD on Martin Flowers website](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html).François Zaninotto made an even stronger critique here: [Spec-Driven Development: The Waterfall Strikes Back](https://marmelab.com/blog/2025/11/12/spec-driven-development-waterfall-strikes-back.html).

My advice is that you avoid SDD.
