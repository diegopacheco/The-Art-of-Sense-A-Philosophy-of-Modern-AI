# Troubleshooting

Using AI to help troubleshoot problems in code, systems, and architectures.

## Debugging with AI using Images

Many people don't know, but most AI coding agents support you dragging and dropping an image and the model can "read" the image and make sense of the image. This is very useful for troubleshooting. AI is impressive at handling images with errors like:
* Frontend/Mobile apps Errors (Screenshots of the app with errors)
* Backend/Infrastructure Errors (Screenshots of metrics, dashboards and alerts)
* Kubernetes Errors (Screenshots of kubernetes dashboards, pod errors, etc)

## Git Archaeology for Troubleshooting

Also, like I explained, AI is very good at using git. AI can navigate into git log and history and figure out a bunch of things there. Sometimes AI would not figure out how to read remote repositories, but you can also git clone repos for AI and then point AI to your file system.

## Analyzing Logs with AI

Like git, AI is great at reading logs, especially if logs have errors and stack traces. AI is impressive at reading logs and finding patterns and issues. AI can also search on the web (all coding agents pretty much have this feature nowadays).
