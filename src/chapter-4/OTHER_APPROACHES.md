# Other Approaches

There are other approaches to building and deploying coding agents beyond the MCP framework discussed in this book.

## Agent 2 Agent

[A2A](https://a2a-protocol.com/).

## We had APIs before MCP

There is some critique that MCPs could be just a [JSON file](https://materializedview.io/p/mcp-server-could-have-been-json-file) since we are re-using the underlying APIS that already existed.

## Claude Skills

[Claude Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills) is another approach to building coding agents, where you can bundle text and scripts together to create an agent.
