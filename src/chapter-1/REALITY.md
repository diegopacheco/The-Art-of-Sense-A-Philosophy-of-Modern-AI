# Reality

Even with all the problemas and the scams. AI is real and AI is here to stay. IDK If AGI will happen one, maybe, maybe not but there is indication we are close to AGI.

Don't be fooled by markething of people saying I have AGI, people lie, and LLM models do not think, even they say "thinking". 

Now we dont need AGI in order to have value from AI. The reality is that AI is a force of disruption, some as we saw with the internet and mobile phones.

Therefore change is happening, and you need to adapt to it. You can either be a victim of change or you can be the driver of change.
