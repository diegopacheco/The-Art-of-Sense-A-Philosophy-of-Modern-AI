# Critical Thinking

Critical thinking is the ability to analyze information objectively and make a reasoned judgment. It involves evaluating sources such as data, facts, observable phenomena, and research findings. Good critical thinkers can draw reasonable conclusions from a set of information and discriminate between useful and less useful details to solve problems or make decisions. Critical thinking is hard because it requires skills and a lot of knowledge. When using AI, critical thinking is essential because AI can produce incorrect or misleading information.

We can use AI in order to get critical thinking feedback about our work. Let's say you have a blog post, an article, a piece of code in a PR, or an architecture design/wiki document. You should not use AI to generate these entire things for you. But let's say you did your homework. Now you can use AI to get critical thinking feedback.

You can ask AI annoying, contrarian, devil's advocate, hard questions about your work. This will help you to see your work from different perspectives and identify potential weaknesses or areas for improvement.
