# Randomness

AI is not precise and not 100% reproducible. It does not matter how good your prompt is, AI will generate different outputs. AI is really random in nature. Cory Doctorow and his amazing post: [LLMs are slot-machines](https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2025-08-16-jackpot-salience-bias-2a696501bba7) cleverly explains the random nature of LLM outputs. If you need 100% precision, Generative AI is not for you, LLMs are not for you.

Generative AI is just trying to predict the next sequence of tokens. That's all, an auto-complete on steroids. You need to understand the random nature of Gen AI when using LLMs.
