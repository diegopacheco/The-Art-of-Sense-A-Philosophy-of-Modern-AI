# Custom Agents

Claude Code allows you to create custom agents. Custom agents can be generated by a prompt. At the end of the day, a custom agent is just a markdown file that lives under the path `~/.claude/agents/AGENT_NAME.md`.

A custom agent is automatically loaded by Claude Code when you start it. You can create, edit, or delete custom agents using the `/agents` command. Custom agents are different from commands. For instance, with commands you need to invoke them using the `/command_name` syntax. Custom agents you can just call them by their name or just tell your prompt to Claude and it will invoke the agent for you.

Here are some ideas for custom agents you can create:
- **Code Reviewer Agent**: An agent that reviews code for best practices, security vulnerabilities, and performance optimizations.
- **Documentation Generator Agent**: An agent that generates documentation for codebases, APIs, or libraries.
- **Bug Finder Agent**: An agent that analyzes code to identify potential bugs and suggests fixes.
- **Refactoring Agent**: An agent that suggests and applies code refactoring techniques to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Test Case Generator Agent**: An agent that creates unit tests or integration tests for given code snippets or modules.
- **Deployment Agent**: An agent that automates the deployment process of applications to various environments.
- **Data Analysis Agent**: An agent that performs data analysis tasks, such as data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- **Project Manager Agent**: An agent that helps manage project tasks, timelines, and resources.
- **Learning Agent**: An agent that provides tutorials, coding exercises, and learning resources for developers.
- **Performance Optimizer Agent**: An agent that analyzes code for performance bottlenecks and suggests optimizations.
- **Security Auditor Agent**: An agent that conducts security audits on codebases to identify vulnerabilities and recommend improvements.
- **SQL Agent**: An agent that helps generate, optimize, and troubleshoot SQL queries.
- **Marketing Agent**: An agent that assists with creating documents, emails, and content that non-technical users can read and understand.

Custom agents are a big and very important feature of Claude Code.
