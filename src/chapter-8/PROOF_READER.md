# Proof Reader

Using AI to Write and Spell Check Documents, AI is a great Proof Reader.

It's common for people to make mistakes when writing documents; sometimes it's just typos, other times it's grammar mistakes or even factual mistakes. AI is really great at finding and fixing all these common issues.

Here is an example of a Claude Code command you could use to proofread a document or your project:

```
~/.claude/commands/english.md
```

english.md
```
# Fix my english
- Read all my files
- Fix all my english issues
- Fix my typos
- Don't touch the HTML files only the markdown files
- Make sure you don't break anything, make sure you don't lose content
```
