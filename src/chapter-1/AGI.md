# AGI

AGI means Artificial General Intelligence, which refers to a type of AI that has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, AGI can perform any intellectual task that a human can do. A lot of critique to LLMs is that LLMs are text machines and therefore thats not enought to understand the world and actually reason. We some attemp to fix that by some massive ammount of computational power and data, and also by adding some external tools to the LLMs (like vision, code execution, web browsing, etc). Such external tools are basically engineering and it's trick to blend AI with traditional software to cover the weaknesses of LLMs.

## It's AGI possible? Could it happen?

YES. I think is possible, I think it can happen. Now no one, knows if will take 10 years or 100 years or never. But I think is possible. Now part of the problem is that there are several different definitions of AGI. Plus we are not there yet, LLMs are not AGI.

## Down ceiling effect (The hobbit House Effect)

Take a look into this image. Perhapes it's another markething trick.

This is a funny effect that is happening, the industry is adapting it's terms, and it's like the houses pictures, sounds like the cealing is going down. First AGI was something that will happen in 100 years, then 50 years, then 20 years, then 10 years, now is something that is already here.

People use terms like "Spark of AGI", "AGI-ish", "AGI Vibes" and many other terms to describe current LLMs capabilities as they were becoming AGI or even close to be AGI.

Same trick happened to `agents`, True agents by defnition should be `reacting to events` and be `autonomous`, but now we have agents that are just LLMs with some tools, and they are called agents. So the cealing is going down. Theregore they use the term `Agentic`. Now everything is `Agentic`, so Agents and Agentic are not the same thing at all. 

Agentic means that something has some characteristics of an agent, but it's not a true agent. Same for AGI, now everything is AGI-ish or has AGI vibes.

## True True True Real AGI

IF that happens, them yes, engineers can be afraid of what will happen to they jobs and yes Vibe-code would take over, but for that to happen we would need to have predictability and reliability on the AGI systems, and we are not there yet even with generative-ai.

IF AGI happens, yes it could be possible that we dont look the code anymore, but we are not there yet. No avidence will be there is a year or 5 years nor 10 years.We need remeber that self-drivign cars are around for more than a decade and they are still not reliable enough for mass adoption.
