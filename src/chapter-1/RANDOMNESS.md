# Randomness

AI is not precise and not 100% reproducible. It doesn't matter how good your prompt is; AI will generate different outputs. AI is really random in nature. Cory Doctorow and his amazing post: [LLMs are slot-machines](https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2025-08-16-jackpot-salience-bias-2a696501bba7) cleverly explains the random nature of LLM outputs. If you need 100% precision, Generative AI is not for you; LLMs are not for you.

Generative AI is just trying to predict the next sequence of tokens. That's all, an auto-complete on steroids. You need to understand the random nature of Gen AI when using LLMs.

This image was generate by GPT 5.1, can you see the issues on the image? AI is good with TEXT, LLMs are all about text. LLMs gets much worst about images and 100x worst with video? Because image and video are not text-based. Funny that the slot machine metaphor from Cory Doctorow post it's 100% spot on on the lack of accurancy, replicability, and precision of LLMs.
