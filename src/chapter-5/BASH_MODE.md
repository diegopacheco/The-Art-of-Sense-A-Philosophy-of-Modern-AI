# Bash Mode

Claude Code has an `Interactive Mode` which I prefer to call `Bash Mode`. In this mode, you can interactively issue [bash commands](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/interactive-mode) to Claude and Claude will run them in the terminal for you.

To activate this mode, you just type `!`, then after that you type whatever bash command you want and then press enter to run.

You literally can call any program or script that you have available in your terminal. For example, you can do: `ps`, `kill`, run `npm`, run maven `mvn`, as long as it doesn't need an interactive shell to run.
