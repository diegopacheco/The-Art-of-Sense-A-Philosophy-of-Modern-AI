# Claude Bash Orchestration

Claude can be run as a unix/linux process in bash. Meaning you can do pipelines, orchestration and all sorts of bash scripting with claude code. In order to run claude in bash you just do:

```bash
claude -p "Your prompt here"
```

This is simple but extremely powerful. Because you can create complex orchestration with claude code in bash scripts. You can chain multiple claude calls, you can use the output of one claude call as the input of another claude call. You can do loops, conditionals, and all sorts of bash scripting with claude code. Such mode is also called, officially [Headless Mode](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/headless).
