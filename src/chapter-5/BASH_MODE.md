# Bash Mode

Claude Code has a `Interative Mode` which I prefer to call it `Bash Mode`. In this mode, you can interactively issue [bash commands](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/interactive-mode) on claude and claude will run in the terminal for you.

In order to active such mode you just type `!` them after that you type whatever bash command you want and them press enter to run.

You literaly can call any program, script that you have available in your terminal. For example you can do: `ps`, `kill`, run `npm` run maven `mvn` as long as is not needs iterative shell to run.
