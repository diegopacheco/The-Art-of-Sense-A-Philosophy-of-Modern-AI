# Chapter 1 - Making sense of AI

First of all, we need to make sense of AI. What is it? How does it work? What are the different types of AI? In this chapter, we will explore these questions and lay the foundation for understanding AI.

AI is 2 steps forward and one step back. AI hallucinates, AI ignores your requests, AI makes mistakes. We need to understand the limitations of AI and how to work around them.

We also need to understand how AI is changing how we do engineering. What are the new ways of working? What are the non-obvious ways we can leverage AI to be more productive and effective engineers?
