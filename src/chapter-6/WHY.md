# Why use AI for Testing?

The reality is that software engineers are under constant pressure for delivery. Such pressure plus imature management, leads to skipping tests. You might not right the best abstraction fo the universe, you might not right the best code of the univer in order to deliver, such trade-offs are fine as long as used with balance and you are not living tech-debt first. Now tests, should never ever be skipped, not matter how much in a hurry you are, not matter how much tight yout deadline is, no happer if sprint is close to the end. Skipping tests is the wrong decision always.

## Testing AI

We know skipping tests is wrong. But all companies they have legacy systems. There is always software before we arrive in a company(unless is a startup on day 1). The realioty is there is so much technical debt that, you can't pay it all at once. Companies pay technical debt but never as much as they should. Quality ends up being compromised. Which is not a wise decision and eventually will have catastrophic consequences.
