# Chapter 1 - Making sense of AI

First of all, we need to make sense of AI. What is it? How does it work? What are the different types of AI? In this chapter, we will explore these questions and lay the foundation for understanding AI.

AI is 2 steps forward and one step back. AI hallucinates, AI ignores your requests, AI makes mistakes. We need to understand the limitations of AI and how to work around them.

We also need to understand how AI is changing how we do engineering. What are the new ways of working? What are the non-obvious ways we can leverage AI to be more productive and effective engineers?

Imagine that AI can be classified in 3 buckets:
1. Revolution of the Machines(Robots are coming for us) -> Dystopian future where AI disrupts many industries.
2. We got dumber -> AI makes us less capable as humans.
3. AI builds a better future -> AI helps us be more productive and unlock new possibilities.

What If all 3 are true! I think all three are true at the same time. AI has scams, lies, nasty things. AI makes mistakes, but AI also makes us less analytical, makes us lazy. Also AI makes us more productive and can unlock new levels of software and solutions we did not have before. I know this might sound difficult but yes, all 3 are true. BTW, I recommend watching all those movies.
