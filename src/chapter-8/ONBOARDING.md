# Onboarding

I don't like onboardings in general. Usually they are a massive waste of time, the idea of onboarding makes a lot of sense but in pratice how people run onboardings is often not effective, IMHO is a complete waste of time.

The common issues I see with bad onboardings are:
* Manager is hands-off and just throw a bunch of links and code and ask people to read
* No Homeworks for the engineer (No output is an anti-pattern)
* No clear goals or expectations
* When are expentations the manager is just training the engineer how he like to work like: "I want story points of 3-5, dont do PRs with more than 10 files, show up to my 101s, update your JIRA tasks, etc". 

This is a complete waste of time, because the engineer show be, actually doing is:
* Make sure you have your enviroment ready (make sure you can run and debug the app)
* Make sure you understand where things are and now they work (test, deployment, infra, monitoring)
* Make sure you understand the basics of the business and the code

Because onboarding is so terrible, pretty much is a 2-4 weeks vacation for the manager. The worst is that is common the engineer gets out of the onboarding and it's not `ready`. So bad expectations game already happen and the engineer is behind.

A good onboarding should have:
* Have the enviroment ready (be able to run and debug the code)
* Homeworks (the engineer must do something, make sure PR, get some task done)
* Short, 1-2 weeks maximum
* Should be closely managed, otherwise it has a chance of being a disaster

Now AI enters the field. Using AI, we can make this much better because, now the engineer can use AI as a private tutor. If the engineer knows how to ask the right questions it can lean much faster.
