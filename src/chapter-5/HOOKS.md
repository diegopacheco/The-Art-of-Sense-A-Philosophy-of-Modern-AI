# Hooks

Hooks are a nice feature that claude code has that allows you to create custom workflows. Hooks allow you to trigger a script for instance that runs all maven tests on the backend, every time claude code finishes refactoring some code in Java. Another example, let's say you want to run a linter or a formatter every time claude code finishes generating some code for you in Javascript. You can create a hook for that.

Here is an example of how to [create a hook](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide) in claude code.
