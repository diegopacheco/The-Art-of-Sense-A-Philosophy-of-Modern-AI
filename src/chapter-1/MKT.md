# Markething

Before I explain the issue with marketing, let's look the following picture.

Gartner's Hype Cycle is a graphical representation of the maturity, adoption, and social application of specific technologies. It helps to visualize the typical progression of an emerging technology from its inception to mainstream adoption.

AI has a lot of hype, the problem with hype is that you have:
* 1. Unreasonable expectations
* 2. Disappointment when those expectations are not met
* 3. Loss of interest
* 4. Abandonment of the technology

Now #1 and #2 are happening, we are not in #3 yet as(2025) but eventually will happen. Why I'm talking about this? Because marketing is fueling the hype, and marketing is not interested in the long-term success of a technology, only in short-term gains.

Also there are terms use that are 100% misleading, to not say lies, for instance, AI or LLM models cannot think, they cannot reason. But all tools and agents today use terms like "thinking", "reasoning", "understanding", etc. which are completely misleading. Some models are also called "Reasoning Models" which is misleading as well.

Here is some evidence:

* [I Think Therefore I am: No, LLMs Cannot Reason](https://matthewdwhite.medium.com/i-think-therefore-i-am-no-llms-cannot-reason-a89e9b00754f)
