Without AI, some migrations tend to always be postponed. Sometimes because the cost is prohibitive, sometimes because the risk is too high, sometimes because the business case is not clear.

However, with AI coding agents, now we live in a time where it's possible to bridge such gaps much faster and much cheaper. AI is not perfect, so expect bugs and setbacks, but the speed gains are unquestionable.

Imagine if you have some code in old technology, let's say Python 2.x. Now, using coding agents, it's possible to migrate the codebase from Python 2.x to Rust, for instance. This is a unique time that provides us great opportunities. Now we need to tweak our mindset and leverage the new tools.
