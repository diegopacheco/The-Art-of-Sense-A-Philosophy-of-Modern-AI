# Popular Agents

There are many coding agents out there. I try and [POC most of them](https://github.com/diegopacheco/ai-playground/tree/main/agents). Here is a list of the most common and useful coding agents. I recommend you play with these coding agents, then you can see which ones you like the most.

## Github Copilot

[Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) One of the first, if not the first coding agent. It is embedded into VSCode and other IDEs. It has a great developer experience. Copilot is in constant evolution. Copilot has one nice thing that is support for many LLM models.

## Codex CLI

There are two flavors of Codex. There is the [web sandbox version](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex) and there is the [CLI version](https://github.com/openai/codex). Codex is a good agent where they have their own LLM Model which is different from Chat GPT model.

## OpenCode

[Opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) is an open source coding agent that works with many LLM models.

## Jules

[Jules](https://jules.google/) is a web sandbox agent by Google backed by Gemini LLM models.

## Kiro

[Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) is a coding agent by AWS. Kiro is a fork of VSCode and has a great developer experience. Kiro is different because it implements [Spec Driven Development (SDD)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html).

## Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) by anthropic is another coding agent. IMHO it's the best agent coding tool out there. Claude code works with anthropic LLM models.
