# Hooks 

Hooks are a nice feature that claude code has that allow you to create custom workflows. Hooks allow you to trigger a script for instance that run all maven tests on the backend, everytime claude code finish refactoring some code in Java. Another example let's say you want run a litner or a formater everytime claude code finish generating some code for you in Javascript. You can create a hook for that.

Here a example of how to [create a hook](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide) in claude code.
