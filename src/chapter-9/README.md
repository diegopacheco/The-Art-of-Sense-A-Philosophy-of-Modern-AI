# Chapter 9 - Learning from AI

AI can be a good teacher. Just keep in mind you better cross-check what the teacher is telling you. A very simple and effective way to cross-check AI is just to ask for links for reference. Then you can go on the internet and read the links and check for yourself if AI is wrong or right.

LLMs still hallucinate; usually they hallucinate when they don't know the answer, which often means not enough data on the topic in their training set. Evidence:
* [ORION Grounded in Context: Retrieval-Based
Method for Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15771)
* [Hallucination is Inevitable:
An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11817)
* [Estimating the Hallucination Rate of Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07457)

So fact-check AI. Besides that, AI is a bar raiser, because you must be able to know that AI is lying to you, so you must level up your game and just do better. Know more than AI, so you can spot when it's wrong.
