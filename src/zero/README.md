# Chapter ZERO

Why I wrote this book?

In the summer of 2024, I spent the whole summer learning about AI. I did 300+ coding POCs, I read several books, I did several courses. In 2025, I tested all AI coding agents I could, I wrote MCPs, I did several experiments.

There is so much out there, there are so many tools and people saying many things. This book should be a compass to guide you on your AI journey for engineering.
