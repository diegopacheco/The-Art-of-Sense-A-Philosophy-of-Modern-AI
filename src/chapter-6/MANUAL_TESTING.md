# Manual Testing

Manual testing it's an anti-pattern. It's wrong, it's slow, it's expensive and does not scale. Human can make mistakes, get tired, bored and frustrated. Meaning that the mood of the QA might influence the quality of the tests.

Tests should always be automated. However there is a sad reality in companies that it's not uncommon to find a lot of manual tests happening. Usually you can catch that if someone or a group of people need to sign a release. Why software is not realed automatically if all tests pass? 

Well, does not matter why this problem happen, but now with the advent of the AI Coding agents is possible to use AI to feed all documentation you might have, all tickets, all print screens and ask LLMs to geenrate End-2-End or even Regression tests for you. Such tests can be written in Cypress, Playwright, Selenium or any other framework you might be using.

Now we will go from manual testing to AI-assisted automated tests.
