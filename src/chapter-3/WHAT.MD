# What is Generative AI? 

The advent of LLMs allow use to use AI models diretly that was previous training. Meaining you can use it right away without needing to train it yourself. This is called "Generative AI" because the model can generate new content based on the input you provide.

You will see many terms around generative AI, like "thinking", "reasoning", or "understanding". To be clear AI models do not actually think, reason, or understand in the way humans do. Instead, they analyze patterns in the data they were trained on and generate responses based on those patterns.

LLM models are like very advanced autocomplete systems. When you type a few words, they predict what comes next based on the vast amount of text they have been trained on. This allows them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.

Even given the limitations such systems are still incredibly powerful and useful for a wide range of applications, from drafting emails to writing code, creating art, creating logos, writting music, writting stories, creating code via AI Coding Agents and much more.
