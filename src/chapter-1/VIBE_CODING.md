# Vibe Coding

Andrej Karpathy coined the term "vibe coding" in one of his [tweets](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en) on FEB 2025.

Vibe coding is a practice where you generate prompts and you `do not look at the code`. You assume AI will take care of everything. However that premise is wrong. AI does not get everything right. AI:
* Ignores your requests: You ask for Java 25, AI delivers Java 21.
* AI Hallucinates: And makes up APIs that don't exist or code that gives you bugs at runtime.
* AI Just ignores you: You ask for a specific library, AI just ignores it and uses something else.

Vibe code is very much like try-and-error, you can build games with it even but don't fool yourself you can't use vibe coding for all things. Not reading the code and not reading the DIFFs is an awful practice. Asking for random changes and hoping the bugs go away is not a strategy. Any serious software engineer with a brain will tell you that vibe coding is a bad idea. 

## Where you can use vibe coding

* It's a small utility: It's very small, you would not do it, and it's not your core business. Example: A small script to convert CSV to JSON.
* It's for throw away discovery: You are prototyping something very fast, and you will throw away the code later.
* It's for learning: You are learning a new language or framework, and you want to get a feel for it quickly.

Considering those use cases, vibe coding is fine. However I would need to say that for the last one you want to read the code. Therefore it is not vibe coding. Now if you want to know is it possible to do this? And you are just aiming for feasibility yes, you can vibe code it but throw away after and do it right.

## Where you MUST NOT use vibe coding

To the point where you should `ban vibe coding`. Your CORE business should not be vibe coded. Vibe coding your core business is a recipe for disaster. If one day we get AGI then we can revisit this. One important note, people lie, and they will market anything as "AGI", so we might have AGI but it might not be what you think it will be. Meaning we still have jobs, this idea that AI will kill engineers jobs is absurd. Thank God at this point people are getting into their senses as the hype cycle with AI is going down.

Your CORE business is how you make money, it's your bread and butter. Who wants to kill your milk cow? No one. Therefore don't vibe code your core business. Because that's a recipe for disaster.

## Vibe Payments

Vibe Coding to some degree is a lack of respect. It's a lack of respect for people's entire careers and hard working years in this profession. Vibe coding means you are not paying attention to the code. Think about this, if AI is doing everything, and you are not paying attention to the code, how much should you be paid? Or should you be paid the same thing every month? IMHO we need `Vibe Payments`. Vibe Coders should be paid with vibe payments. It would look like this:
* One month you get 50% less
* Another month you get 30% less
* Next month you get 20% more
* Another month is no payments
* Next time you owe -240% of your salary

You would not like it. But that did not stop you from throwing bad code at others. My friends believe me AI generates a lot, a lot of trash code. We need to do better.

## Vintage Coding

I run [coding dojos](https://codingdojo.org/) without AI for decades. A coding dojo it's space where senior engineers work with junior engineers, and they all leanr from each other. Coding dojos follow [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) practices.

More importanlty coding dojos, existed before AI. In a proper coding dojo, you dont use the "auto complete" features from you ide, you type everything. Coding dojos should be done without AI. Forcing you to think abd be able to do things without AI. This I was calling it "Vintage Coding" because now everyboddy does coding using AI. So having this practive where we can use coding without AI (by design) force us to know our tools, and help us with:
* Mastering our tools
* Being able to move fast without (consulting google or AI all the time) - no waiting
* Being able to quickly figure out solutions
* Improving our problem solving skills
* Improving out Data Structures and Algorithms game
* Improving attention to details

It's important to use AI to increase some productivity(which I think is something ballpark between 10-30% MAX). But is also important to do the vintage coding(coding dojos) often, to keep us healthy and in shape. Like you goto GYM because you are not a hunter and stay siting in a chair all day long in zoom calls :-). 

## How you drive a car?

IDK you but I just drive a car. I don't think. It's natural, it's organic. I dont need to make any effort it's so easy. Now ask your self, is this the same for you? You probably will say YES. Well, them we need ask ourselfs the next question - why? I tell you way.
* Because you pass the driver license exam
* You study the rules of the road
* You practice driving a lot (for years probably)

Now the effect is thay you do that with such efficiency. Now Imagine if you was driving a car and looking the the manual, literally, you have a thick book with rules, and while driving you check the manual every time:
* You need to turn left
* You need to turn right
* You need to stop at the red light
* You need to check the speed limit
* You need to backup

You will be such a terrible driver. I dont think anyone drive like this. Because we don't allow anyone to drive, there is a BAR. But for engineering there is not BAR. Any one can do anything, even not being even close to be qualified. Now I'm not flearint with extreme regulation of engineering. But what I'm saying imagine if I tell you that a huge numner of programeers, code like the driver I described. Wow, no way Diego, this sucks! Well ineats of the manual they was using StackOvverflow, and before using forums, and now, guess what they are using LLMs and AI Agents.

We need have proenfiency!
