# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) was created by [Anthropic in 2024](https://www.whatismcp.com/). The idea of MCP is that you have a standard way to provide context to LLMs. MCP is an open standard that allows developers to create and share context packages that can be used by different LLMs.
