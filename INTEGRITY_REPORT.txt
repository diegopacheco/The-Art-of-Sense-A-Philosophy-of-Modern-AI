================================================================================
STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY

✓ Zero chapter exists and linked
✓ Part I (3 chapters) - Complete
✓ Part II (3 chapters) - Complete
✓ Part III (3 chapters) - Complete
✓ Epilogue properly structured

Chapter Breakdown:

================================================================================
NAVIGATION INTEGRITY
================================================================================

✓ All chapter links in SUMMARY.md are valid
✓ All section links in SUMMARY.md are valid
✓ All cross-references between chapters work (except 8 typo instances)
✓ Table of contents is complete and functional

================================================================================
CASE SENSITIVITY NOTES
================================================================================

Two files use uppercase .MD extension:
  - /src/chapter-2/WHAT.MD
  - /src/chapter-3/WHAT.MD

Status: OK - SUMMARY.md correctly references them as .MD
These will work correctly on all filesystems (case-sensitive and case-insensitive)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

CRITICAL (Must Fix):
  1. Fix the 8 broken links in epilogue/BOOK_INDEX.md
     Replace all instances of: RAMDONNESS.md
     With: RANDOMNESS.md

OPTIONAL (Consider):
  1. Add CLAUDE_BASH_ORCHESTRATION.md to SUMMARY.md in Chapter 5
     (Currently accessible via index but not in main navigation)

  2. Add RESOURCES.md to SUMMARY.md in Epilogue
     (Currently accessible via index but not in main navigation)

  3. Consider renaming WHAT.MD to WHAT.md for consistency
     (Not required - current setup works fine)

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The book publication is structurally sound with all content intact.

✓ All 81 files referenced in SUMMARY.md exist
✓ No files were deleted or corrupted
✓ 621 out of 629 internal links are valid (98.7%)
✓ Book structure is complete and navigable
✓ Content is preserved and accessible

Only issue: 8 broken links due to a single typo (RAMDONNESS vs RANDOMNESS)

Overall Assessment: PUBLICATION READY after fixing the typo in BOOK_INDEX.md
