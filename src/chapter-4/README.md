[Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ai-agents/) are not new. I remember coding an agent in university back in the 2000s. However agents are even [older than that](https://medium.com/@tasospapalias/sibyls-and-servants-the-roots-of-artificial-intelligence-in-ancient-greek-lore-b28257e98a0a). Agents are software that respond to change or an event on your behalf, agents can be 100% autonomous or assisted.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI Agent is a type of software agent that uses AI to perform tasks or computations, autonomously or semi-autonomously. AI agents can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They can range from simple rule-based systems to complex machine learning models that adapt and learn from their interactions. LLMs are a very good foundation to create AI agents.
