# Fooled By AI

IF AI is lying to you, how do you know?

Think about that. If you don't know anything AI is "talking about", basically you are in deep trouble. You must be able to validate, fact check and even disagreen with AI output.

High dependency on AI is bad, we should be able to program if we dont have internet or are running out of tokens.

Do you know how to know when a human using AI is fooling you? Do you know if you are fooling yourself with AI?

## Outsorcing Gyn Workout

Think about this, we could easily pay someone to go to the gum for us. That person can do push ups, run, lift weights. Be on the gym everyday and at the same time never be on the gym. Genius! Well the issue is that your "contractor" will be strong and in shape but you will not. Altought you can claim the glory of going to the gym, you do not have the benefits, you only have status.

With AI is the same thing. Anyone can use AI to generate code, does that mean we are done there? Thing about it, everyboddy has the same AI, same models, same capabilitites. So just using AI is not differentiating.

## Solutions vs Wrappers

Now, every single startup is building or vibing something with .ai or a new Agentic. Unther the hood most of the time is just a wrapper arounf OpenAI API or Anthoropic API. So what is the real value add?

I love Rappers but I never like Wrappers. In my book Principles of software architecture modernization I wrote about the dangerous of wrappers with internal shared libraries. Now we have the same danger but with external tools. There is a explosion of trools, new tools, all old tools being rebranded to ai, or ai features popping up in softwares we would not expect.
