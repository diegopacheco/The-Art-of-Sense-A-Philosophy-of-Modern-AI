# What are Agents?

Agents are into the heat of the storm. Since AI is like a slot-machine, and we have "predictability" problems, applying AI into "features" or anything "consumer facing" it's a big risk. 

Now there is this field where we can apply AI and "it's fine-ish" if fail, because happens "under the hood", that field it's called "engineering". Coding agents are AI agents that help developers to write code. Thefore being AI use case where you have more chances of success. Because [95% of AI Pilots Fail](https://www.selector.ai/blog/95-of-ai-pilots-fail-heres-how-to-be-the-5/). Engineering is a safe bet and a safe start for AI adoption.

AI Agents it's how we get AI use cases into engineering. There are many valid use cases for AI in engineering like:
* Code Asistants
* Code Generators
* code Reviewers(with careful and cavets)
* Troubleshooting
* Documentation
* Testing (test geenration)
* Code Migrations
