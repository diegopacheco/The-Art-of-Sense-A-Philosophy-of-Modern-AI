# Mirror on Steroids

If you are great AI will make you even greater. I belive Gen-AI tools like AI Coding Agents like Claude Code are amazing. ChaptGPT great. Co-Pilot great. However if you use this tools 24/7 and you shutdown your brain, you will worse your skills.

You can't use AI for all, ALL THE THINGS, all the time. Becasue your over-dependency on AI, it's like a virus or a desease. Everything we do in like without balance is bad.

We should not be afraid of AI, we should not ignore AI. But if we dont have `non-AI time` we are making ourselfs dumber. In that sense we need to make the right cycle. The right cycle will be use AI but also make time without AI.

## From Hunters to Gatherers

In the past, we was all hunters, we had to work hard to get food. Such bad times, tought us and make us stronger. Now it's so easy to get food, it's so easy to get all in your home without any effort. AI it's like that, it's effortless, it's friction-less, you want it? You got it.

Now you need to think that, you need time without AI. Why? Because you also need to be your-self, IF you do all the things that someone say and you dont have a voice anymore, you are in trouble.

## From Mirror to Ownership

Someone smart, knows what to use AI for, and what not to use AI for. For instance, you can use AI all day long, or not use at all. You must remember that the `ownership` is yours. Dos not matter if you use all or nothing from AI, it's your responsability to own the results. Meaning you need review the code, you need change it, you need to critique it, you need to make it yours.

## The bad mirror effect

If you suck, AI will make you suck even more. Because AI allow you to create trash or add poison into the systems much faster. IF you are not paying attention to delais. If you are not doing the hard work to get better, fact check AI, do your homework, you will be in trouble. AI can lie to you and you would not notice. But get this, good people will know you suck! Now, people can know you suck much faster!
