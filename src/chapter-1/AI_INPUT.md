People see AI as ouput. As a way to "Beef Up" engineers. It's not wrong but you cant't just use AI and never look the code, this is recipe for disaster.

AI can be great teacher, however we need to always rember the teacher makes mistakes too. Using AI for input still a great advantage, you preserve the output to be yours.
