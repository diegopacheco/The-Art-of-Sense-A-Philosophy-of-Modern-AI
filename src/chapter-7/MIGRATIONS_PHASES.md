# Migrations in Phases

A decent migration has phases. Depending on the migration, you will have more phases. It's very important to have a diagram where you can visualize the phases of the migration.

Here is an example of migration phases:
1. Phase 0 - Inventory
2. Phase 1 - Planning
3. Phase 2 - Preparation
4. Phase 3 - Execution
5. Phase 4 - Validation
6. Phase 5 - Rollback (if necessary)
7. Phase 6 - Monitoring

Execution itself should be broken down into smaller phases depending on the size of the migration. Validation is something that should also happen during preparation and execution.
