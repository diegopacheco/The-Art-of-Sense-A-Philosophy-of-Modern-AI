# Software Context

Software is not in a good shape. Current state of software is not great. Technical debt is bigger than ever. Companies complely ignore technical debt and focus only on new features.

Denis Stetskov has this amazing article about our current software quality crisis: [The Great Software Quality Collapse: How We Normalized Catastrophe](https://techtrenches.substack.com/p/the-great-software-quality-collapse). I like Denis post quite a lot and agree 100%. The only thing is that he talks about memory leaks took much that someone could say, but we have more memory today so thats fine. I'm this is being memory and optimization, is the fact that Lead time is not getting better, bugs are not getting fixed faster, and overall quality is declining. That is being memory leaks.

Such acknowledgment of the problem is the first step to solving it. It's very important to understand that state of afairs are not good. AGI is not here yet and only God knows when will arrive(IF arrive), AI can create a lof ot thrash code, introduce nasty bugs, and generally make things worse if we don't have good software practices in place. I will cover this extensively in the later chapters.

Now is not the time to pay less atention in software, the opposite we must be more vigilant, pay more attention.
