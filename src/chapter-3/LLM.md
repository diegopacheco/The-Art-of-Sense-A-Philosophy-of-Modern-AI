# Large Language Models (LLMs)

[Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) are a type of generative AI specifically designed to understand and generate human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of textual data, allowing them to learn the patterns, structures, and nuances of language. LLMs are fed with books, articles, websites, and other text sources to develop a deep understanding of language.

LLMs are incredible good handling text-based tasks, such as:
- Text Generation: Creating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.
- Translation: Converting text from one language to another.
- Summarization: Condensing long pieces of text into shorter summaries while retaining key information.
- Question Answering: Providing accurate answers to questions based on the information they have been trained on
- Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text.

Common popular LLM modes include:
