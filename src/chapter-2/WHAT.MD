# What is Traditional AI? 

Traditional AI, also known as classical AI refers to AI approaches that tasks a single problem or even using a single algorithm. LLMs in the other case can handle a variety of tasks and problems using the same underlying model.

## General Engineering vs Traditional AI

In engineering or programming we usually have:
```
--> Input   [ Computation  ] -> Results
--> Program [              ]
```

In engineering we are trying to create a program that can transform inputs into desired results.

In Traditional AI we have:
```
--> Input   [                ] 
--> Desired [   Computation  ] -> Program
    Result  [                ]
```

Fundamental difference is that in traditional AI we are trying to generate a program that can produce the desired results from the given inputs.
