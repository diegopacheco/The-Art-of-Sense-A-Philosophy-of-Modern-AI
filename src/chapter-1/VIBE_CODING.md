# Vibe Coding

Andrej Karpathy coined the tern "vibe coding" in one of his [tweets](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en) on FEB 2025.

Vibe coding is a pratice where you generate prompts and you `do not look at the code`. You assume AI will take care of everything. However that preisse is wrong. AI does not get all right. AI:
* Ignore you requests: You ask for Java 25, AI deliver java 21. 
* AI Halucinates: And make up API that don't exist or code that give you bugs at runtime.
* AI Just ignores you: You ask for a specific library, AI just ignore it and use something else.

Vibe code is very like try-and-error, you can build games with it even but dont foll yourself you cant use vibe coding for all the things. Not reading the code and not reading the DIFFs is a awful pratice. Asking for randon changes and hoping the bugs go away is not a startegy. Any serious software engineer with a brain will tell you that vibe coding is a bad idea. 

## Where you can use vibe coding

* It's a small utility: It's very small, you would not do it, and it's not your core business. Example: A small script to convert CSV to JSON.
* It's for throw away discovery: You are prototyping something very fast, and you will throw away the code later.
* It's for learning: You are learning a new language or framework, and you want to get a feel for it quickly.

Considering that use cases, vibe coding is fine. However I would need say that for the last one you want read the code. Therefore is not vibe coding. Now if you want know is possible to do this? And you are just aiming for pheasability yes, you can vibe code it but throw away after and do it right.

## Wehere you MUST NOT use vibe coding

To the point where you should `ban vibe coding`. Your CORE business should be be vibe coded. Cive coding your core business is a recipe for disaster. IF one day we got AGI them we can revisit this. One important not, people lie, and they will market anything as "AGI", so we might have AGI but it might now be what you think it will be. Meaning we still have jobs, this idea that AI will kill engineers jobs is absurd. Thanks God at this point people are getting into sense as the hype cycle with AI is going down.

Your CORE business is how you make money, it's your bread and better. Who wants to kill your milk cow? No one. Therefore don't vibe code your core business.Because that's a recipe for disaster.

## Vibe Payments

Vibe Coding to some degree is a lack of respect. It's a lack of respect for people entires carrears and hard working years in this profession. Vibe coding means you are not paying attention into the code. Think about this, if AI is doing everything, and you are not paying attention on the code, how much you should be payed? Or should you be payed the same thing every month? IMHO we need `Vibe Payments`. Vibe Coders should be payed with vibe payments. It would look like this:
* One month you get 50% less
* Another month you get 30% less
* Next month you get 20% more
* Another month is no payments
* Next time you own -240% of your salary

You would not like it. But that did not stop you throw bad code on others. My friends belive me AI generates a lot, a lot of thrash code. We need to do better.
