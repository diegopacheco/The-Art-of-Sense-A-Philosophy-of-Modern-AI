# Proof of Concepts (Poc)

POCs can be used for a variaty of use cases and pruposes, including:
1. feasibility study: Proof litary something is possible.
2. Learning: Learn how a API, library, framwork or technology works.
3. Re-Informent: Repeat an alo 10x so it stick into your brain.
4. Experimentation: Try out new ideas or approaches without the pressure of a full project.
5. Demonstration: Showcasing a concept or idea to stakeholders or team members.
6. Validation: Validate assumptions or hypotheses before investing significant resources.
7. Risk Reduction: Identify potential challenges or issues early in the development process.
8. Innovation: Explore new technologies or methodologies to foster innovation within a team or organization.
9. Communication: Facilitate communication and collaboration among team members by providing a tangible example.

Some of this use cases, AI cannot help you, such as:
- Re-Informent: AI cannot help you to repeat something 10x so it stick into your brain.
- Learning: AI can help you to learn faster, but the actual learning process requires your active engagement and practice. Meaning you need have output, you can just "copy" the result from AI, you need to understand it and apply it yourself.
- Innovation: All people have the same AI, same apis, this is not how you will inovate.

The other use cases, AI can help you to some extent, such as:
- Feasibility Study: AI can help you quickly prototype and test ideas to determine their feasibility
- Experimentation: AI can assist in generating ideas and approaches for experimentation.
- Demonstration: AI can help create demos to showcase concepts or ideas.
- Validation: AI can help you design tests and experiments to validate assumptions or hypotheses.
- Risk Reduction: AI can help identify potential challenges or issues by analyzing data and providing insights.
- Communication: Facilitate communication and collaboration among team members by providing a tangible example.

Another usage of AI can be that you can use AI just to get something working quickly, I remember in my life how many times, I took me days or weeks trying to figureout something on the internet, now you can ask AI to do a POC in seconds. You still need todo a second or third pocs, I like doing 10x, but the zero to demo time now is zero.
