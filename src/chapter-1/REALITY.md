# Reality

Even with all the problems and the scams. AI is real and AI is here to stay. I don't know if [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) will happen one day, maybe, maybe not but there is no indication we are close to [AGI](https://perry-douglas.medium.com/a-classic-con-e8c7f9f3d61d).

Don't be fooled by marketing of people saying I have AGI, people lie, and LLM models do not think, even if they say "thinking".Now we don't need AGI in order to have value from AI. The reality is that AI is a force of disruption, same as we saw with the internet and mobile phones.

Therefore change is happening, and you need to adapt to it. You can either be a victim of change or you can be the driver of change.
