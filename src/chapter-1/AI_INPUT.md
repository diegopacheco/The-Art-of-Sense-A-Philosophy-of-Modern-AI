# AI Input

People see AI as ouput. As a way to "Beef Up" engineers. It's not wrong but you cant't just use AI and never look the code, this is recipe for disaster.

AI can be great teacher, however we need to always rember the teacher makes mistakes too. [Using AI for input](https://diego-pacheco.blogspot.com/2025/09/ai-output.html) still a great advantage, you preserve the output to be yours.

## A tale of High School

When I was in the high school. I rember a teacher of mine saying that people would goto google.com and just search for past year class and find the same homework and download a power point presentation and simple change they name on it. Of couse this would never work because the teach was smarter and usually people doing that took ZERO.

Using AI just for output, "vibe coding" it's shuting down your brain and we are not evern close to have AGI. So thisis a recipe for disaster. IMHO is not different than copying someones homework and just putting your name on it. 

Now ofcouse, people will use internet and it's okay to be "inspired" by somebody else work, no one start from scrath but you need spend the time and review and change it.

## Lack of Respect

It's lack of respect to throw some code into someone to review when the reviwer is the first person to read it, before even the "maker" or to be more honest the "viber".For this reason and 100 other reasons you need read code AI produces.

## You + AI

Now if you use AI for input and do the due dilligence process, them you actually are doing this right, you are using ai for input but the output is yours, it's your code, your work, must have your finger prints, that way we do best of both worlds. You learn, you produce and you grow.
