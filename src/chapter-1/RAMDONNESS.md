# Ramdoness

AI is not precise and not 100% reproduceble. Does not matter how goood your prompt is, AI will generate different outputs. AI is really random in nature. Cory Doctorow and his amazing post: [LLMs are slot-machines](https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2025-08-16-jackpot-salience-bias-2a696501bba7) cleverly explain the random nature of LLM outputs. IF you need 100% precision, Generative AI is not for you, LLMs are not for you. 

Generative AI just trying to predict the next sequence of tokens. That's all, a auto-complete on asteroids :-). You need understand the ramdon nature of Gen AI when using LLMs.
