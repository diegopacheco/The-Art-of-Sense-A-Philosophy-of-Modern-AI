# What is Claude Code?

Claude code is a AI coding agent. Claude code blends Gen-AI LLM models with engineering in a tool focused on the terminal. It allows developers to interact with AI models directly(via API) from their command line interface (CLI) to generate, modify, and manage code.

Claude code it's very efficient for developers because developers are used to use the terminal for all the things. Claude code is fast and very easy to use. So the bottleneck is not using claude code, but knowing the things you can do with it.
